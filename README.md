## 🌐 Moving to the Fediverse

I'm gradually transitioning away from corporate-controlled social networks towards the Fediverse, as their ethical and moral practices don't align with my values. I've already locked my X (formerly Twitter) account and now actively use decentralized platforms like Bluesky, Mastodon, Pixelfed, and Linkstack. This transition will be reflected in my profiles and connections over time.

## 🇪🇺 Moving to Codeberg

Just as I seek ethical alignment in my social interactions, I seek it in the digital home of my code. I am migrating my repositories to **[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/imigueldiaz)**, choosing a platform hosted in the European Union that respects data privacy and shares my values of software freedom. This move reflects a conscious decision to distance my creative output from corporate surveillance and align with a community-driven ethos.

## 📜 The Narrative of Code

I am a developer who views code not just as instructions for a machine, but as a form of literature—a narrative that must be coherent, structured, and meaningful. My journey began in the halls of **Librarianship and Information Sciences**, a background in the humanities ("letras puras") that might seem distant from the binary world of software, yet is intimately connected to it.

For over **24 years**, I have bridged these two worlds. I approach software development with the mindset of an archivist and a storyteller: organizing chaos into structure, ensuring data flows with semantic precision, and refactoring legacy code to tell a clearer, more modern story.

My expertise lies in the **architecture of information**—transforming data across formats (CSV, JSON, XML), optimizing its retrieval, and ensuring its integrity. Just as a librarian understands the soul of a library is not the books but the access to knowledge, I understand that the soul of software is not the syntax, but the value it delivers to the user.

Currently, I am deepening my craft in **C# Performance** and **Docker**, ensuring that the stories my code tells are not only beautiful but efficient and resilient.

## 📸 Amateur Photography

When I'm not immersed in the world of code, you'll often find me behind the lens of my camera. As an amateur photographer, I've discovered that photography is not just a hobby but a way to quiet my mind and tap into my creative side. It's a refreshing break from the analytical nature of my work in software development.

Through photography, I'm learning to explore my artistic skills and see the world from new perspectives. I've come to appreciate that not every shot has to be perfect. Even blurred or trepidated photos can have their own unique charm and beauty. It's all about capturing moments, experimenting with different techniques, and most importantly, having fun along the way.

Photography has taught me valuable lessons about patience, observation, and the power of perspective. It's a continuous journey of growth and self-discovery, and I'm excited to see where this creative outlet takes me next.

## 📝 Writing Passion

I've been writing all kinds of short stories and microfiction since I was a child. Writing has always been a true passion of mine, allowing me to express my creativity and imagination. However, I'm currently experiencing a bit of a writing block. To overcome this and keep my writing spirit alive, I've decided to repost some of my favorite posts from my now-defunct blog on my Substack. It's a way for me to revisit my past works, share them with a new audience, and hopefully reignite my writing spark. Feel free to check out my Substack, [Stories Along the Way](https://ignaciodemigueldaz.substack.com/), to explore my fictional microstories and stories.
